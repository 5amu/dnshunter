# ~# dnshunter.sh

Make DNS and BGP assessment easier. This implementation in Go grants more speed.

It is unfinished, but the old script can be found in [the legacy folder](/legacy).
Just a program to perform many DNS checks automatically. It should be improved and 
perfected. Right now is pretty accurate, but it might need more refinement.
